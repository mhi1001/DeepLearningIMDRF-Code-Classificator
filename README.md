## Research

**Introduction:**
In the healthcare sector, accurate documentation and communication are critical for effective patient care and regulatory compliance. 
Messages from doctors often contain a wealth of information that needs to be accurately categorized according to the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) codes. 
These codes are essential for classifying and standardizing medical device-related information. 
However, manually identifying the correct IMDRF codes from doctors' messages is a time-consuming and error-prone process.

**Problem statement:**
**Context:** Accurate documentation in healthcare is critical for patient care and regulatory compliance.
**Problem:** Manually identifying IMDRF codes from doctors' messages is inefficient and error-prone due to the complexity of medical terminology.
**Impact:** This inefficiency leads to increased workload, potential misclassification, and compromised data quality.
**Solution**: To create an app that assists companies in identifying the appropriate IMDRF codes for messages sent by doctors.

**Research Questions:**
- How accurately can the AI model classify doctors' messages into the correct IMDRF codes?
- What are the most common errors made by the AI model in identifying IMDRF codes from doctors' messages?
- Which model is better suited for predicting IMDRF codes?

**Hypotheses:**
- The AI model will classify doctors' messages into the correct IMDRF codes with an accuracy rate of at least 90%.
- The most common errors made by the AI model will be related to ambiguous or highly specialized medical terminology.
